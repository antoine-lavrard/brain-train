# Fork of brain train to generate backbone models for [PEFSL project](https://https://github.com/antoine-lavrard/few_shot_demo)

- Example scripts for training are available in [launch_training.sh](launch_training.sh),[launch_training_resnet12.sh](launch_training_resnet12.sh). 
- One can evaluate the accuracy of the models in few shot tasks with [evaluation.sh](evaluation.sh).
- [to_csv.sh](to_csv.sh) allows to export the results of the evaluation in a csv file.
